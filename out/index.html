The day to day tasks involve using an agile methodology to create stories where each component will first be created in a React environment so that the backend and frontend can work independently of each other. Once AEM environment components are ready I will integrate the React component into AEM, the JavaScript 
        will then be translated to es6 reusable classes. Some environments are using LESS and others are using Sass to compile the css. 
        • Create reusable AEM/JavaScript components that can be used across the business. 
        • Lead the team into a new technology stack, so that the code is readable and maintainable.
